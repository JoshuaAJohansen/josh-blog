  As we go forward on the journey, we get the opportunity to craft maps for
  future travellers. I believe we have the technology and capabilities to solve
  a majority of the worlds problems if we can understand ourselves better, and
  help each other more. This internal understanding, and present awareness in
  union with the discipline to alchemize beautiful software

  With relentless curiosity and creativity, discipline to act, and a burning
  love we can set a new standard for how the game of life is played. Here I will
  curate my ideas, help spread the wisdom of others, and evolve this into
  whatever it, and I become in the future.

  I do what I can to support both the local nursery at San Bruno Mountain Watch
  and Weed Warriors to maintain the habitat of San Bruno. I live in Daly City
  and am blessed by the mountain every morning as the sun comes over the hill.
  Due to highways being put in place and housing developments there are fewer
  cows grazing the hills and so it is beneficial for humans to weed certain
  areas to give the native plants a better chance of thriving. If you are in the
  bay I welcome you to check out the trails of
  <strong>
    <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/93xEf7VKWb9iwGSi6">San Bruno</a>
  </strong>
  on the north and south side of Guadalupe Canyon Parkway, parking is only a few
  dollars a day, and makes a nice afternoon escape from the city.
